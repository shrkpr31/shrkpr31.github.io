  abstract={Technology adoption has been advocated to be an important way to improve agricultural productivity and welfare of the 
farmers in the semi-arid regions across the globe. Government of Karnataka implemented Bhoosamrudhi programme in four districts of 
the state (Bidar, Chikballapur, Dharwad and Udupi) as a pilot project to increase the crop yield and income of 
smallholder farmers. This programme was launched on the theme of technology adoption, along with convergence among 
different departments of agriculture. Farmers have been classified into five categories based on their levels of technology 
intensification to assess the impact of different levels of technology intensification on their income level. 
The research is built on a primary survey conducted in pilot districts of the state in 2018 over a sample of 1,465 farmer 
households. The results are generated using econometric methods of propensity score matching (PSM) and inverse probability 
weighted with regression adjustment (IPWRA), which highlight that higher the intensification, higher the net returns to the 
farmers. The results state that non-adopters would benefit additional ₹3,200 per month if they adopt at least one level of 
technology intensification. Hence, this programme turned out to be a successful model for smallholder farmers in semi-arid 
region of India. Steps should be taken to maintain and expand the momentum of the adoption to ensure food and livelihood 
security in the economy.},

  abstract={Semi-arid regions are one of the most vulnerable regions of climate change to agriculture. Karnataka, a semi-arid state of India has warmed by 0.4 °C with 
declining trends in average annual rainfall by 10 % over the last century, is highly vulnerable to climate change. To adapt with this climate change impact, 
Government of Karnataka along with CGIAR institutes and agriculture universities had initiated the Bhoo-Samrudhi program in 2013 to promote climate smart agriculture 
practices in the state. The primary aim of this program was to enhance crop productivity by 25 % and farmers income by 20 %. Firstly, this study aims to identify who 
adopts CSA practices and at what scale? Secondly, how much additional income farmers earn by adopting CSA practices as compared the non-CSA but improved agricultural 
practices, and the traditional practices. Thirdly, this study estimates marginal increase in farmers income at difference scale of adoption of CSA practices. Finally, 
this study identifies possible challenges and opportunities in upscaling the adoption of CSA practices in the state. A primary survey using a semi-structured questionnaire
was conducted among the selected 1466 farmer households in four districts of Karnataka (Bidar, Chikballapur, Dharwad, and Udupi). The sample consisted of 833 adopter 
farmers and 633 non-adopter farmers. Non-adopter farmers were those who were following traditional practice of crop cultivation and rest of the farmers are treated as 
adopters. The study used multinomial logistic regression to explore what made adopter farmers different from non-adopter farmers. Further, we had applied propensity score 
matching and inverse probability weighted regression adjustment methods to estimate the impact of scale of adoption of CSA practices on farmers income. The results 
highlighted that landholding size, education levels, and asset ownership likely affect the adoption of various levels of CSA practice intensification. Moreover, the 
impact of adoption on farmers' income is estimated to be Rs. 4845 for low intensified, Rs. 6801 for medium intensified, and Rs. 7858 for highly intensified farmers, in 
comparison to the improved technology adopters. Therefore, we can conclude that adoption of single technology may not be able to solve the problem, instead technology 
intensification can be a more effective mechanism to deal with the vulnerabilities and create resilience against climate change. Technology adoption has been a proven 
method to improve agricultural productivity as well as income of the farmers in semi-arid regions across the globe. However, an upcoming method to improve food and 
livelihood security is through sustainable technological intensification. Thus, this study contributes to providing empirical and evidence-based policy suggestions to 
promote technology intensification instead of just promoting one single technology. Therefore, technology intensification can be considered as a package of multiple 
technologies for the farmers to improve their crop and land productivity, and to gain higher economic return.},

  abstract={Doubling farming households’ income through occupational diversification to the non-farm sector has been advocated to be of paramount importance in an agrarian 
economy such as India. The purpose of this paper is to analyse the effects of non-farm activities on rural household incomes in four different Indian states by using a 
propensity score matching technique and developing an endogenous switching model. The research is based on secondary data taken from four quinquennial rounds of employment and 
unemployment surveys conducted by the National Sample Survey Organization. The matching results indicate a maximum monthly rise in per capita income of Rs. 60 in Gujarat 
and a minimum increase of Rs. 18 in Rajasthan among rural households employed in the non-farm sector as compared to the farm sector. The findings confirm that rural non-farm 
structural diversification cannot be viewed as a blueprint for increasing rural household incomes in different states. Further, it suggests the need to segmenting the 
different states on the basis of agricultural development for increasing rural incomes. The study argues that Indian states with a strongly developed farm sector 
i.e. Gujarat and Punjab are not ideally suited to undergo structural changes in their economic pursuit. The estimates suggest that the transition of rural households from 
farm to non-farm-sector activities is a very weak strategy in agriculturally developed states of Gujarat and Punjab, whereas non-farm diversification becomes a pivotal 
strategy for increasing rural household incomes in less agriculturally developed states such as Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh. A contrasting point that arises from these 
evidence is that although diversification to the non-farm sector leads to higher income, but the resultant figures are very scanty. The present study contributes to the 
existing literature by providing evidence and policy implications on rural non-farm diversification in India and its impact on the rural household income. The study can help 
the policymakers in framing policies aiming at increasing the income of the rural household through the structural transition of the rural economy.},

  abtract={Laser land leveling (LLL) is a climate-smart technology that improves water use efficiency and reduces risk in crop cultivation due to weather variability. 
Hence, this technology is useful for cultivating water-intensive crops in a sustainable way. Given this background, the state government of Karnataka initiated to 
promote LLL in drought-prone districts and selected Raichur district for implementation. Moreover, farmers in this district had observed drought situation during monsoon 
 paddy growing season in 2018. Therefore, this study attempts to investigate the importance of LLL technology for paddy cultivation under drought conditions. A primary survey 
with 604 farmer households had been conducted in Raichur in 2018. Among them, 50% are adopters of LLL who have been selected purposively and rest 50% are non-adopters 
who have grown paddy in the adjacent or nearest plot of the laser-leveled plot. The adoption and causal impact of LLL has been estimated using propensity score matching, 
coarsened exact matching and endogenous switching regression methods. The result reveals a positive and significant impact of LLL on paddy yield and net returns to the farmers. 
The results indicate an increment of 12 and 16% in rice yield and net income, respectively, for LLL adopters in comparison to the non-adopters of LLL.The major limitation 
of the study is that it does not adopt the method of experimental study due to certain limitations; hence, the authors employed a quasi-experimental method to look at 
the possible impact of adoption of LLL. There have been various agronomic studies focusing on the ex-ante assessment of the LLL. This study is an ex-post assessment of the technology 
on the crop yield and farmers' income in a dry semi-arid region of India, which, according to the authors, is the first in this approach.},

the farm sector to the non-farm sector. This study examines rural non-farm employment patterns in Uttar
Pradesh, India, to identify the drivers of household employment choices and the impact of increased
income levels on poverty. The shift from the agricultural sector to the non-farm sector—across all
expenditure and landholding classes—is drastic. If non-farm employment increases, household income
rises and rural poverty falls. Promoting crop diversification—and providing extensive infrastructure,
financial, and technological support—could help localized micro-enterprises engage in post-harvest
activities.},
