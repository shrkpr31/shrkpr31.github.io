I am working as an Academic Associate (Economics) at Indian School of Business, Mohali. I am assisting faculties with courses like Managerial Economics, The Business of Food, Artificial Intelligence for Business and Society, Economics for Small and Medium Enterprises, Designing Markets, and Market Competition and Antitrust Policies. Prior to this, I have worked at Plaksha University, as a Research Fellow assisting faculties in teaching delivery as well as research work.
